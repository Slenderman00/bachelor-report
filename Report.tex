\begin{abstract}
  This document explores the future of model-based sensor management, focusing on the NETCONF protocol and YANG data models. We introduce Red-Netconf,
  a plugin for the event-driven visual programming language Node-RED, which implements NETCONF support. Alongside this, we present the NetconfAggregator 
  plugin for Grafana, demonstrating how NETCONF can enable flexible, lightweight, and fault-tolerant sensor management solutions that are easy to configure.
  To validate these tools, we develop a reference implementation comprising two NETCONF-enabled thermometers, a NETCONF-enabled LED strip, and a server 
  running Node-RED, Grafana, and the NetconfAggregator. Additionally, we analyze the security of NETCONF when used over the SSH protocol, 
  highlighting its robustness and potential for secure network management.

\section{Introduction}
There are many paradigms of commercial sensor management and monitoring. Organizations use among other things
PLC (programmable Logic Controllers), IoT devices and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to 
manage and monitor their sensors. For commercial use 
some of these alternatives are more popular than others. There are also a large amount of different higher level protocols
like MQTT, HTTP and SNMP that can be used to manage and monitor sensors. We propose using the NETCONF protocol 
with YANG sensor models for management. We believe that the low level nature of NETCONF and the openness of the protocol combined with 
its ability to function over any transport layer makes it the perfect candidate for securely transporting sensor data.
This work will be done in collaboration with Lightside Instruments AS.
\\
\\
This document will cover the following three topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Work Methodology:} An indept analysis of the knowledge base around work methods like Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall. 
  With a focus on how our work methodology differs from these.
  \item \textbf{NETCONF and YANG sensor management}: A qualitative analysis of the NETCONF and YANG protocols and how they can be used to manage sensors and 
  a description of our work with Lightside Instruments AS on NETCONF and YANG sensor management.
  \item \textbf{NETCONF Security}: A qualitative analysis of the security aspects of the NETCONF protocol.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lightside Instruments AS}
Lightside Instruments is a company specializing in developing instruments with model based network management 
for use in networking, network interconnect testing and telemetry. 
They design their instruments with YANG (RFC7950) \cite{bjorklundYANG11Data2016} models and NETCONF (RFC6241) \cite{ennsNetworkConfigurationProtocol2011} protocol. 
The instruments are based on IETF standards and drafts, 
and are implemented with software tools available in Debian, programmable 
logic and open hardware \cite{LightsideInstrumentsYANG}.
\\
\\
Lightside Instruments operates on the cutting edge of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined protocols. Innovating with both NETCONF, YANG and
our very own Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft for a standardized way of testing network perfomance. Trough this work 
the company aims to create the future of robust network protocols and open standards.


\section{Technical background}
The following are terms and technologies that are essential to understanding this article.

\subsection{NETCONF and YANG}
NETCONF \cite{ennsNetworkConfigurationProtocol2011} is a model based Network Configuration Protocol.
Each NETCONF device presents the acquiring device with a YANG \cite{bjorklundYANG11Data2016} data model
consisting of the device state and parameters. 
Each data model has a set of constraints making them error correcting.

\subsection{Yuma123}
Yuma123 \cite{vassilevVlvassilevYuma1232025} is an open source NETCONF and YANG implementation.
Yuma123 is available as a Debian package and is maintained by Lightside Instruments AS.

\subsection{NodeJS}
Node.js \cite{NodejsRunJavaScript} is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It is used to build JavaScript applications that can run independently of a web browser.
Node.js is popular for building server-side applications as it is relatively performant and 
it allows developers to work with the same language on both the client and server.

\subsection{Node-Yuma123}
Node-Yuma123 \cite{Nodeyuma1232025} is a NodeJS package that implements a set of Yuma123 bindings.
It allows for efficient NETCONF and YANG development in NodeJS.

\subsection{Node-RED}
Node-RED \cite{LowcodeProgrammingEventdriven} is an open source low code programming tool for event driven applications.
It is developed by IBM and is based on Node.js \cite{NodejsRunJavaScript}.
Node-RED is used to connect hardware devices and APIs through a visual programming interface.

\subsection{Grafana}
Grafana \cite{GrafanaOpenComposable} is an open source data visualization tool.
It is used to visualize arbitrary data from different data sources.

\subsection{XML and XPATH}
XML stands for Extensible Markup Language \cite{ExtensibleMarkupLanguage}. It is a
markup language that is used to encode data in a format that is both human and machine readable.
XPATH \cite{XMLPathLanguage} is a language for navigating XML documents.
An XPATH expression allows for the selection of arbitrary nodes in an XML document.

\subsection{Scrum}
Scrum \cite{HomeScrumorg} is a framework for agile \cite{AgileSoftwareDevelopment2025} software development. 
The term Scrum is derived from the game of rugby, where a scrum is a way of restarting play after a minor infringement \cite{ScrumRugbyUnion2025}.

\subsection{Kanban}
Kanban \cite{Kanban2025} is a framework for agile software development.
The term Kanban is derived from the Japanese word for "signboard" or "billboard" \cite{KanbanDevelopment2025}.

\subsection{Waterfall}
Waterfall \cite{WaterfallModel2025} is a framework for software development.
The waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development.

\subsection{Extreme Programming}
Extreme Programming \cite{ExtremeProgramming2025} is a framework for agile software development.
Extreme Programming takes the best practices of software development and takes them to the extreme, hence the name.

\section{Work Methodology}

\subsection{Scoping Review}
A Scoping Review is a type of literature search with the goal of scoping out a topic of research.
Scoping Reviews are often initiated at the beginning of research projects as a way of finding existing 
research on the topic on interest.

\subsubsection{Question}
This review examines the claims that Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Extreme Programming and DevOps 
increases worker productivity substantiated by empirical evidence.

\subsubsection{Search Strategy}
The following is our search strategy for the scoping review.
We will be searching for quantitative studies on the efficiency of the following work methodologies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scrum
  \item Kanban
  \item Waterfall
  \item Extreme Programming
  \item DevOps
\end{itemize}
We will be searching the following databases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item IEEE Xplore \cite{IEEEXplore}
  \item ACM Digital Library \cite{ACMDigitalLibrary}
  \item Google Scholar \cite{GoogleScholar} (Meta database)
\end{itemize}
We will also be searching the following industry websites:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Agile Alliance \cite{AgileAlliance2015}
  \item Scrum.org \cite{HomeScrumorg}
  \item DevOps Institute \cite{Organisations}
  \item Scrum Alliance \cite{ScrumAllianceFind}
\end{itemize}
Our search will consists of a set of primary and secondary keywords.
The primary keywords are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scrum
  \item Kanban
  \item Waterfall
  \item Extreme Programming
  \item DevOps
\end{itemize}
The secondary keywords are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Effectiveness
  \item Efficiency
  \item Productivity
  \item Performance
  \item Success
  \item Failure
\end{itemize}
The search will be done using the following search string:

\begin{adjustwidth}{-4em}{0pt}
\begin{verbatim}
       (Scrum OR Kanban OR Waterfall OR "Extreme Programming" OR DevOps) 
                                      AND
(Effectiveness OR Efficiency OR Productivity OR Performance OR Success OR Failure)
\end{verbatim}
\end{adjustwidth}

\subsubsection{Inclusion Criteria}
The scoping review will include articles meeting the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Published after January 1, 2020
  \item Published in English
  \item Relevant to the scoping review question
  \item Empirical evidence
  \item Quantitative studies
  \item 20 first results from each database
  \item Evaluating the effectiveness of the following methodologies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Scrum
    \item Kanban
    \item Waterfall
    \item Extreme Programming
    \item DevOps
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Result}
After applying the inclusion criteria to a set of 60 articles, we discovered that 5 of them were duplicates.
The 55 remaining articles were screened by title and abstract, resulting in 12 articles being excluded.
The 43 remaining articles were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 42 articles being excluded.
Only one article was assessed to be eligible for this review.

\subsection{Scrum}
Scrum is a framework for agile software development. The term Scrum is derived 
from the game of rugby, where a scrum is a way of restarting play after a minor infringement \cite{ScrumRugbyUnion2025}.
The use of the term Scrum in software development was first introduced by Takeuchi and Nonaka in 1986 in a paper titled 
"The New New Product Development Game" \cite{NewNewProduct}.
In the paper, the authors argue for a new approach to product development where the different stages of development are 
overlapped, rather than sequentially executed in a "pass the baton" fashion. This differs from 
the then popular NASA type PPP (Phased Project Planning) model \cite{PhasedProjectPlanning1968}.
\\
\\
Modern Scrum development consists of a set of sprints, these sprints consists of a pre-defined set of tasks
that are to be completed in the pre-defined sprint time frame. Each task or "story" is assigned an arbitrary number of points
that represents the complexity of the task. The sprint is the completed when there a no more points to be completed or the time frame is up.
There are many modern flavors of Scrum, like Accenture's \cite{AccentureLetThere} Autoscrum
which is a scrum framework that was first introduced in the talk "AGILE TRANSFORMATION?
FOR COMPLEX SYSTEMS?
...NO WAY!" by Brehm \cite{brehmAGILETRANSFORMATIONCOMPLEX2025} as can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:autoscrum}}.
Or the scaled agile framework (SAFe) \cite{Framework} which is a framework developed by Scaled Agile Incorporated  which introduces 
SAFe Scrum see \textit{Figure \ref{fig:sAFE}}.
Or the Deloitte's \cite{DeloitteAuditConsulting} "The Agile Landscape v3" that consists 
of all the different frameworks and methods used for project management. See the Scrum section in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:the_agile_landscape}}.

\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Evidentiary foundation}
With only one article "A Theory of Scrum Team Effectiveness" by Verwijs and Russo \cite{verwijsTheoryScrumTeam2023} we can conclude that there
is no empirical evidence that Scrum increases worker productivity or efficiency. Whilst the findings of the article seems promising, and the article is thorough, 
there simply is not enough research on the topic to comment on the evidentiary foundation of Scrum, this is something taken in too account by the authors of 
the article. 
Only a handful of other articles have been published on the topic, but most of them fall outside the exclusion criteria of the scoping review as they
have been published before 2020.

\subsection{Kanban}
Kanban is a framework for agile software development. The term Kanban is derived from the Japanese word for "signboard" or "billboard" \cite{KanbanDevelopment2025}.
A Kanban board is a visual representation of the tasks that need to be completed, the board consists of multiple columns that represent the 
different stages of the development process. As a task is worked on it traverses the columns of the board until it is completed.
This provides a visual representation of the state of the project and allows for easy identification of bottlenecks in the process.
Kanban is a much more flexible and lean approach to project management than Scrum, as it follows closer to the agile manifesto's principles 
of flexibility and adaptability \cite{ManifestoAgileSoftware}.

\subsubsection{Evidentiary foundation}
With no articles found in the scoping review we can conclude that there is no empirical evidence that Kanban increases worker productivity or efficiency.

\subsection{Waterfall}
The waterfall \cite{WaterfallModel2025} is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Sets of tasks are grouped into phases, 
where each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. This is reminiscent of the NASA type PPP 
(Phased Project Planning) model \cite{PhasedProjectPlanning1968}.
The waterfall model mirrors the traditional problem solving process, of breaking a problem down into a set of smaller problems,
and solving each of the smaller problems in a sequential manner. This is something that is found at the core 
of all project management methodologies.

\subsubsection{Evidentiary foundation}
With no articles found in the scoping review we can conclude that there is no empirical evidence that Waterfall increases worker productivity or efficiency.

\subsection{Extreme Programming}
Extreme Programming \cite{ExtremeProgramming2025} is a framework for agile software development. Extreme Programming takes 
the best practices of software development and takes them to the extreme, hence the name. A core part of Extreme Programming is the use of
pair programming \cite{PairProgramming2024}, where two developers work together on the same code.

\subsubsection{Evidentiary foundation}
With no articles found in the scoping review we can conclude that there is no empirical evidence that Extreme Programming increases worker productivity or efficiency.

\subsection{DevOps}
DevOps is the combination of development and operations, it is the practice of combining software development and IT operations.
This keeps the developers close to the day to day operations of the software they are developing. A result of developer operations is 
the use of automated continues integration and continues deployment (CI/CD) \cite{ContinuousDelivery2025} systems as the responsibility 
of the deployment falls on the developers. This methodology fosters early error detection and correction.

\subsubsection{Evidentiary foundation}
We did not manage to find any articles that assess the effectiveness of DevOps versus other paradigmes, but.
DevOps and Research Assessment (DORA) \cite{DORAGetBetter} is a research department at Google that focuses on 
researching assessment methods for DevOps. They publish a yearly report on the state of DevOps. Other than DORA independent research
into the topic is scarce and whilst research is being done there is currently not a strong enough evidentiary foundation to make 
any claims about the effectiveness of DevOps.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The scoping review has made it clear that there is a lack of research into the effectiveness of different work methodologies.
The industry seems focused on researching performance metrics for each methodology, rather than the 
effectiveness of the methodology itself.

\subsection{Our Work Methodology}
At Lightside Instruments we work with both hardware and software in a small team. 
This workflows lends a great deal of flexibility to our work.
With most engineers doubling as both hardware and software engineers, we have found it cumbersome to use a strict work methodology like most agile frameworks.
Due to the small size of our team we have adapted a DevOps like approach that is tailored for our needs. 
We have a set of tasks that are defined in a git repository. After a task is completed a pull request is submitted and the task
is marked as pending review. When the request is approved the task is marked as completed and the code is merged into the main branch.
We not only use automated continues integration and continues deployment (CI/CD) systems for our software, but also for our hardware.
We have developed a set of workflows that are used to automatically generate the production files for our hardware. 
\\
\\
Whilst there is no empirical evidence or any research suggesting that our work methodology is more effective than any of the other methodologies, 
we have found it to be a good fit for our needs. And we feel that it adheres close the principles set forth by the agile manifesto 
\cite{ManifestoAgileSoftware}.

\subsection{Observations and Outcomes of our Work Methodology}
During the past six months working on this project we experienced several cases of hardware failure.
When a case of hardware failure were severe enough to warrant action on our part we called this a "side quest".
When a side quest was initiated, the team would temporarily shift focus to address the issue. 
These side quests often involved debugging hardware, replacing faulty components, 
or reconfiguring systems to ensure proper functionality. 
While these tasks were not part of the original project scope, 
they provided valuable insights into the robustness of our designs and workflows. 
For example, during one side quest, we discovered that the Wi-Fi chipset on one of 
our Raspberry Pi zero 2w's had failed. Due to our decision to solder this Raspberry 
directly onto our ethernet4pizero-poe card we decided to try and de-solder the broken Wi-Fi chipset
instead of re-building the whole prototype. 
These side quests proved to be an invaluable way of keeping 
productivity up without shifting focus to unrelated tasks. 
\\
\\
Taking on side quests would not have been possible without the flexibility 
of our work methodology. These are issues that in some cases would have gone 
unsolved if we had weekly targets to meet or a rigidly designed development plan.
During the duration of the project there were plenty of times when side quests led 
to changes in the project plan and even new projects in itself. A great example of this 
was the development of easyNetconf after having developed the initial version of Node-Yuma123
we discovered that it quickly became cumbersome to work with due to the object-oriented nature 
JavaScript and the functional nature of C. 

\section{NETCONF and YANG sensor management}

Hardware management is an essential part of administrating a larger network. 
Together with Lightside Instruments AS we have 
developed open source tools for YANG and NETCONF aimed at hardware sensor management.
We have built a reference implementation of a NETCONF system that tackles this issue.
Our reference implementation consists two NETCONF temperature probes,
a data aggregator, a data visualization tool and
a tool for quick management of NETCONF devices.
\\
\\
The following sections will describe the project and how each of the components are implemented.
An illustration of the architecture of the project can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:architecture}}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{refimparch2.drawio.png}
  \caption{Architecture of the NETCONF and YANG sensor management system.}
  \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{NETCONF}
NETCONF \cite{ennsNetworkConfigurationProtocol2011} is a mode based Network Configuration Protocol
implemented by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) in the RFC (Request for Comments) 6241 \cite{ennsNetworkConfigurationProtocol2011}.

\subsection{YANG Model}
The YANG model is a model used to describe the state and actions of a NETCONF device.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has developed a set of standard YANG models for NETCONF devices.
For the purposes of this project we will not be using the standard YANG models,
but instead we will be using a custom YANG model developed by Lightside Instruments AS that only 
describes the state of thermometers. See \textit{Figure \ref{fig:yang}} for the YANG model.
\\
\\
The YANG model consists of a container "thermometers" that can contain multiple 
this container, contains a list of thermometers where each thermometer 
contains two leafs one containing the thermometer name and one containing the temperature in the form 
of a 32-bit integer that is limited from -27315 degrees Celsius, the field does not support floats and the value must
therefore be divided by one hundred after being read. The max value in the model represents the max value of a 32-bit integer where the most
significant bit is used as the sign bit.

  \begin{verbatim}
    module lsi-thermometers {

          leaf name {
            type string;
          }
          leaf value {

              "Temperature in degrees Celsius multiplied by 100.";
            type int32 {
              range "-27315..max";
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  \end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsection{Node-Yuma123}
Yuma123 is an implementation of the NETCONF standard that is written in C.
It consists of a NETCONF server written in C, an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) client 
and a yangcli interpreter. The yangcli interpreter is a command line tool that can be used to
interact with NETCONF devices using YANG models and yangcli commands. yangcli
translates the yangcli commands into NETCONF RPC calls and sends them to the NETCONF device.
Yuma123 also presents an API that can be used to interact with the NETCONF server called 
libyuma-dev.
\\
\\
Node-Yuma123 is a set of NodeJS bindings for the Yuma123 API. It is written in C++ and created
to resemble the original C API as closely as possible. Node-Yuma123 also implements some 
new functions like asynchronous connections. Implementing this was quite a challenge as the 
libyuma-dev API is not thread safe. Instead of running each connection in a new thread we
stack the instructions using libuv \cite{LibuvDocumentation} and run them in the main thread. This 
resolves most of our threading issues, but some issues still remain. 
These issues are related to how libyuma-dev allocates memory.


\subsubsection{easyNetconf}
C is a low level functional programming language, there are many implementations of the C compiler.
All of these implementations follow the C standard set forth by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) in the ANSI C standard. Due to JavaScipts object-oriented nature we decided to create 
a wrapper around the node-Yuma123 library. This wrapper allows us to use the node-Yuma123
library in an object-oriented way.

\subsection{Node-RED}
Node-RED is a low code programming tool for event driven applications.
It makes it possible to create arbitrary flows that function as a compatibility layer
between different systems and protocols. The low code nature of Node-RED makes arbitrary system
integration accessible even for the lay person.

\subsubsection{Red-Netconf}
The development of Red-Netconf \cite{LightsideinstrumentsRednetconf} arose from the need for an orchestrator to manage interactions between multiple devices. 
Node-RED was chosen as the orchestrator due to its extensive plugin repository, which supports a wide range of protocols and software. 
This flexibility makes Node-RED an ideal choice for integrating NETCONF devices with any system.
Enabling arbitrary interactions between any device.
Red-Netconf \cite{LightsideinstrumentsRednetconf} implements the following two 
nodes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Netconf Session}: This node is used to create a NETCONF session with a NETCONF device.
  \item \textbf{Netconf Yangcli}: This node is used to send NETCONF Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to a NETCONF device using yangcli commands.
\end{itemize}
Using these two nodes we are able to create Node-RED flows that can manage NETCONF devices.

\subsubsubsection{Temperature alert}
As an example of how the Red-Netconf nodes can be used we created
a Node-RED reference flow that collects data from a thermometer and switches on an LED
when the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, this can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:red-netconf}}.

\newpage

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Node-RED flow using Red-Netconf nodes that monitors a temperature sensor and 
  switches on an LED when the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius.}
  \label{fig:red-netconf}
\end{figure}

\subsubsubsection{Rover control}
Another example is the control system for our rover. The rover is a Roomba vacuum cleaner controlled over rs232
by a Raspberry Pi zero. It presents a NETCONF interface that it can be controlled with this flow can be seen in 
\textit{figure \ref{fig:rover}}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rover.png}
  \caption{A flow for controlling our NETCONF rover.}
  \label{fig:rover}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Yangcli \cite{YumaYangcliManual} implements a set of commands for interacting with any NETCONF server over ssh. 
Using yangcli commands in the nodes makes them extremely versatile allowing for a node to perform any Remote Procedure Call. 
The yangcli commands are translated into Remote Procedure Calls and send to the specified server. An example 
of a configured node can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:yangcli-node}}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{yangcli-node-settings.png}
  \caption{The properties of a Red-Netconf Yangcli node.}
  \label{fig:yangcli-node}
\end{figure}

\newpage

The node also supports Node-RED's mustache style templates, using these templates we are able to access data passed into the node
inside our yangcli commands. \textit{Figure \ref{fig:yangcli-node-template}} shows how we dynamically can fetch 
sensor data from a device containing multiple temperature sensors using the following 
yangcli command \textit{xget /thermometers/thermometer[name='\{\{sensor\}\}']} note that instead of using a 
static name as seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:yangcli-node}} we are using the mustache style template 
\textit{\{\{sensor\}\}}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{yangcli-node-settings-wildcard.png}
  \caption{A yangcli-node with a mustache style template for the sensor name.}
  \label{fig:yangcli-node-template}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Grafana}
Grafana is an open source data visualization tool \cite{GrafanaOpenComposable}. Since its inception ins 2014 it has become the industry standard
for data visualization. It is used to visualize arbitrary data from different data sources.
We have developed a solution for fetching and visualizing arbitrary NETCONF data using Grafana.
We call this solution NetconfAggregator.

\subsubsection{NetconfAggregator}
NetconfAggregator is a NodeJS package that uses the easyNetconf wrapper 
\cite{heimonenSlenderman00Netconfaggregator2025} to aggregate NETCONF data and store 
it in a postgresql database. The data is stored in the form of a time series consisting of an ID, a timestamp and the 
raw XML data from the NETCONF device. This allows the data to be extracted and visualized using XPATH queries.
An example of this can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:netconf-aggregator-memfree}}.
This example shows how the query \textit{"//proc/meminfo/MemFree"} can be used to create a graph of the memory usage 
on a raspberry pi through the NetconfAggregator datasource plugin in Grafana.
\\
\\
Figure \ref{fig:netconf-aggregator} shows the architecture of the NetconfAggregator, consisting
of a PostgreSQL database, a NetconfAggregator instance and a Grafana instance running the NetconfAggregator datasource plugin.
The NetconfAggregator gets the state of each NETCONF device using the yangcli command \textit{"xget /"} which
fetches the state of the device. The response is then stored in the database.
When the NetconfAggregator receives a query from the datasource plugin it applies the specified XPATH to 
the relevant data-range in the database and returns the result to the datasource plugin.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{memfree.png}
  \caption{Querying the memory free data on a raspberry pi using XPATH and the NetconfAggregator plugin.}
  \label{fig:netconf-aggregator-memfree}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{NetconfAggregator.png}
  \caption{NetconfAggregator architecture.}
  \label{fig:netconf-aggregator}
\end{figure}

\newpage

We quickly discovered that processing XPATHS is processor intensive. Especially when the data set is large.
Grafana also has a tendency to send all the queries belonging to a dashboard at once therefore, we decided 
to implement a caching system, where the results of the XPATH queries are cached in memory, stored in a hash table.
However, this did not work as expected, as the queries were arriving at the same time the responses did not 
have time to reach the cache before the next identical query arrived.
To solve this we implemented a queue system, we call it the event queue. 
When a query goes to processing it is simultaneously added to the event queue.
Future identical queries are delayed until the processing of the first query is completed.
A delay is added to each request that the server receives. This delay is based 
on the number of queries that are currently being processed, and thus makes
sure that no two identical queries are processed at the same time.
An illustration of how requests are processed can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:xpath-query}}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{xpathquery.drawio.png}
  \caption{XPATH query processing.}
  \label{fig:xpath-query}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsection{Decentralized monitoring}
We believe that the power of NETCONF lies in its ability to be used in a decentralized manner.
This means that multiple aggregators can be used to manage the same NETCONF devices. 
The example in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:decentralized-monitoring}} shows two servers each containing a node-red instance, a NetconfAggregator 
instance and a Grafana instance. The node-red instance and the NetconfAggregator functions completely independently of each other.
Thus making the monitoring system completely separate from the management system. The example consists of a normal networking setup
consisting of three NETCONF enabled switches, a NETCONF enabled temperature sensor and a NETCONF enabled alarm.
This architecture allows for arbitrary control and monitoring of the NETCONF devices using the NetconfAggregator and Node-RED.

\newpage

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{architecture1.png}
  \caption{Decentralized monitoring of NETCONF devices using Grafana, NetconfAggregator and Node-RED.}
  \label{fig:decentralized-monitoring}
\end{figure}

An example of this kind of decentralized architecture can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:decentralized-monitoring}}.
This example consists of two servers running both a NetconfAggregator and a Node-RED instance. Due to the way NETCONF works 
both of these data aggregators and orchestrators can operate on the same devices simultaneously,
note that there are a few situations where node-red might create some race conditions but, these are complex 
flows this only applies to complex flows that are dependent on an internal state. All stateless
flows will function without race conditions as the state of a NETCONF device is stored in the device.

\newpage

\subsection{Our Reference Implementation}
After developing our tools and hardware prototypes we decided to create a reference implementation.
The goal of the implementation was not only to test the stability of our tools but also function as 
a product demonstration, as most of our tools are quite low-lever it can be hard to demonstrate the 
functionality of these tools without multiple devices interacting together as can be seen in 
\textit{Figure \ref{ref:reference-implementation}}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{setup.jpg}
  \caption{Our reference implementation consisting of two thermometers a NETCONF controllable Led strip, a Node-RED instance, a Grafana instance and a NetconfAggregator instance.}
  \label{ref:reference-implementation}
\end{figure}

\newpage
We built three different NETCONF thermometers. Two of the thermometers were built on top of 
a yet to be released product, the Ethernet4pizero-poe shield. This shield adds 
power over Ethernet to the Raspberry Pi zero creating a cheap and portable solution 
for NETCONF hardware development. This shield was purpously created in the hope that 
we would be able to build a temperature probe on top of it. It has been in development by 
Vassilev and Heimonen since the summer of 2024. An image of our first thermometer can be seen in 
\textit{Figure \ref{ref:temp-one}}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{temp-sensor-one.JPG}
  \caption{Temperature sensor one, consisting of a Raspberry Pi zero and an Ethernet4pizero-poe shield. \\ 
  \textit{Note: the shield does not contain a transformer, and therefore it is 
  not galvanically isolated, this limits the potential use cases of the shield as there might be 
  large differences in voltage potentials between ground and the devices ground.}}
  \label{ref:temp-one}
\end{figure}

Our third thermometer is quite experimental and not yet finished.
Due to its experimental nature we have decided to include it anyway. 
Small form Factor Pluggable (SFP) is a type of module often used in network switches to 
make Network Interface Cards (NIC) easily replacable and the swithces easily configurable. 
An SFP port features two Serializer Deserializers (SerDes) lanes and most importantly for our purposes 
an Inter Chip Connect (I2C) lane. Using this I2C lane one can in theory create an SFP sensor probe. 
This allows for the utilization of empty SFP ports for the monitoring of temperature, humidity etc. 
We created such a module as can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{ref:temp-sfp}} an example of how the SFP is used 
can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{ref:temp-sfp-spark}}.

\subsection{NETCONF Versus SNMP}
Simple Network Management Protocl (SNMP) \cite{schonwalderSimpleNetworkManagement2006} is a protocol proposed in 2006 that aimed 
to standardize network monitoring and management. Like NETCONF and YANG SNMP is also model based, the difference comes in how the models are acquiered.
Whilst a NETCONF server serves its own YANG models to the client upon request, SNMP requires the system administrators to acquire their own Object IDentifier (OID).
An Object Identifier much like a YANG model is a data structure that defines data types and locations. The Object Identifiers consists of strings of numbers.
Each number represents the section in a leaf. ie: \textit{'1.2.3.4'} would mean that \textit{.2} is a child of \textit{.1} but, \textit{.2} is the second child of \textit{.1} and \textit{.3} 
is the third child of \textit{.2} and so on. The Contents section of this document is an excellent analogy for this kind of hierarchy as it functions in the 
exact same way.
This type of hierarchical data model is quite standard and is found in almost all data modeling languages like JSON and XML. The difference is the fact that the data model 
is transported separately from the data itself and in the case of SNMP the data models is something that must be acquired manually.


\subsection{Open Source Hardware and Software Development}
All software developed by Lightside Instruments is open source, published under 
the Internet Software Consortium (ISC) license \cite{consortiumISCOpenSource2024} while 
all hardware is licensed under the TAPR open hardware license \cite{TAPROpenHardware}. 
All of Lightside Instruments hardware products are also certified or in the 
process of getting certified by the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA).
\\
\\
We believe that when developing secure system's transparency is key therefore it is of the 
utmost importance that all development happens as transparently as possible in the public eye.
Open source software development also allows for third party contributions, this greatly 
increases the speed at which innovation occurs by allowing developers and engineers to collaborate openly. 
This collaboration fosters a community-driven approach to development where ideas are shared freely 
without any commercial incentives.
Many modern companies sell Software as a Service (SaaS) products, this kind of software is fundamentally 
incompatible with open source development and is something that we are fundamentally opposed to.
We believe that we must strive to create an ecosystem of software and hardware that is not only free in a
monetary sense but also free as in freedom — unrestricted by the constraints of capitalism.





\section{NETCONF Security}
The security of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) is an important part of any
NETCONF setup. NETCONF is developed in a manner that allows it to function
over any transport layer, where the most commonly used is secure shell (SSH) \cite{lonvickSecureShellSSH2006}.
By utilizing SSH the protocol is able to outsource the security of the transport layer 
allowing the protocol to focus on the management of network devices instead
of the security of the transport layer. This type of compartmentalization is common 
when it comes to IETF standards. Other notable examples of this 
are the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) \cite{seoSecurityArchitectureInternet2005} 
and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) \cite{rescorlaTransportLayerSecurity2008} protocols.

\subsection{SSH hardening}
A secure shell (SSH) is only as good as the configuration of the SSH server.
The process of securing an SSH server is called "hardening".
There are many ways to harden an SSH server. The following are some of the 
more common practices. 

\subsubsection{Diffie-Hellman}
Asymmetric encryption is one of the most common ways of securing an SSH server.
This involves every user generating a public/private key pair, the
public key is then passed to the server and the private key is kept on the client.
The server can then use the public key to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted
by the private key. A central step in initializing an SSH connection is the 
key exchange (KEX) between the client and server. This is done through 
the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) KEX protocol.
As seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:diffie-hellman}} the exchange starts by 
the two parties in the key exchange selecting a large common prime, in this case
\textit{p = 7}, after this a generator \textit{g} of \textit{g(p)} is selected
this generator must also be shared between both parties. The generator 
is a primitive root modulo of \textit{p}.
A number \( g \) is a \textbf{primitive root modulo of \( p \)} if:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \left( g^k\Mod{p} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{p-1} n = \frac{(p-1)p}{2}
\]
This means that the sum of the generator raised to the power of \textit{1-p modulus p} will always be the 
same as the sum of all integers from \textit{1} to \textit{1-p}. Therefore the expression can also be written as:
\[
\{ g^1\Mod{p},\;g^2\Mod{p},\;g^3\Mod{p},\;\dots,\;g^{p-1} \Mod{p} \} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots, p-1 \}.
\]
After the generator has been selected each client generates a secret number.
Each party calculates a public key \textit{pubk} that is to be shared using their \textit{secret}.
\[
pubk = \{g^{secret} \Mod{p}\}
\]
The shared secret \textit{s} can then be calculated by using the other parties public key,
the clients secret and the large common prime \textit{p}.
\[
s = \{pubk^{secret} \Mod{p} \Mod{p}\}
\]

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diffiehellman.drawio.png}
  \caption{An illustration of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol. \\**The generator number is a primitive root modulo of \textit{p}.}
  \label{fig:diffie-hellman}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Now assuming that the bad actor as can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:diffie-hellman}} has intercepted
all traffic it will be to mathematically complex for the bad actor to calculate the shared secret 
based just on the large common prime \textit{p}. Assuming the bad actor is trying the 
General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) we can calculate the computation approximate complexity using the following
big O expression where \textit{n} is the current complexity of \textit{p}. If $p=127$ then $n=2^8$
\[
O(n)=\exp((\log n){2/3}).
\]
Assuming that \textit{p} is a 1024-bit number there is 
then the computation complexity of solving the shared secret will be 
\[
O(2^{1024})=\exp((\log 2^{1024}){2/3}).
\]
While this is much better than the complexity of a brute force attempt $O(2^{1024})=exp(2^{1024})$
it is still computationally impossible for a conventional computer.
An illustration of the running computational complexity can be seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:running-complexity}}

\newpage

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph.png}
  \caption{A plot of the running computational complexity of GNFS versus A brute force attempt on a logarithmic scale.}
  \label{fig:running-complexity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Private Public Key Authentication}
One might wonder if SSH uses the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol to create a shared secret 
used for encryption then, what are the Public and Private keys used for?
After the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol has finished the SSH server sends the SSH client a challenge.
This is called challenge-response authentication \cite{ChallengeResponseAuthentication2024}, the 
server send the client a unique string. The client creates a hash of this unqiue string. The hash 
is then encrypted using the clients private key and sent back to the server, this functions as 
a signature for the unique string. The server can then use its public key to decrypt the signature and check if 
the hash matches the unique string.
\\
\\
Why is not just all data encrypted using two pairs of private keys and two pairs of public keys in a form 
of dual-key encryption as seen in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:dual-key}}?
Notice that the bad actor is storing all the data sent between Alice and Bob.
This might remind you of the recent store now and decrypt later craze that has come about due 
to recent advances in quantum computing and cryptography. But, it is not. 
If Alice's system were to be compromised by the bad actor they could simply use 
Alice's private key to decrypt Alice's part of the communication.
Whilst if they were only using the key pair for authentication and using the 
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol for encryption this would not present an issue.
The issue is not the key pairs in itself but the fact that the keys are static, 
the more data that is encrypted using the same key, the greater the potential damage if 
the key is ever compromised.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dual-key.png}
  \caption{Dual-key encrypted communication between Bob and Alice.}
  \label{fig:dual-key}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Fail2ban}
Fail2ban is a daemon \cite{Fail2banFail2ban2025} that scans an SSH servers auth log for 
unwelcome intrusions. If an intrusion is detected it creates a system firewall rule to block the IP address.
Whilst a correctly configured SSH server should be secure without fail2ban they still experience multiple brute-force attacks
every hour if they are open to the internet. This can be draining on the SSH servers performance and the system resources.
Therefore, it is practical to have a tool that detects and blocks the bad actors. In 2024 the CVE-2024-6387 \cite{CVERecordCVE20246387} vulnerability
was discovered, this vulnerability allowed a bad actor to perform a denial of service attack on all OpenSSH servers through 
a race condition in the OpenSSH servers authentication handling. This is a vulnerability that while not 
totally mitigated by fail2ban the risk of this happening would be greatly reduced.

\subsection{Node-RED}
The security of NETCONF becomes mute if the rest of the system is not secured. Therefore it is of the upmost 
importance to secure the Node-RED instance as per the Node-RED documentation \cite{SecuringNodeREDNodeRED}.
Node-RED has support for both HTTPS and a user authentication system with tunable permissions out of the box.
This means that different users can have different permissions, some might only have permission to read flows while others
can both create and read flows. It is also worth mentioning that Node-RED can be configured to encrypt the \textit{flows.json} file using 
the systems key store if one is available. The \textit{flows.json} file is important to secure as it will contain the NETCONF authentication credentials
if the connection is not using private public key authentication. 

\section{Conclusion}
We set out to bring support for NETCONF to both Grafana and Node-RED, this involved creating 
custom tools and libraries that would allow for seamless integration of NETCONF devices into these platforms. 
Through the development of Node-Yuma123, easyNetconf, Red-Netconf, and NetconfAggregator, we have successfully achieved this goal. 
Our tools have been tested in various scenarios, demonstrating their versatility and reliability.
The reference implementation provided a practical demonstration of the capabilities of our tools. By integrating NETCONF-enabled thermometers, 
a data aggregator, and Grafana as a visualization tool, we showcased how NETCONF can be used effectively for sensor management. 
The implementation also highlighted the flexibility of our tools in adapting to different use cases, such as the rover control flow.
While the tools and implementations have proven to be effective, there are areas for improvement. For instance, the caching mechanism in NetconfAggregator 
could be further optimized to handle high query loads more efficiently. Additionally, we could have worked out an IEEE standard for our SFP thermometer
thus making the proposal a bit less experimental.
Overall, we hope that the work we have done will contribute to the popularizing of NETCONF as a protocol for network monitoring and 
administration. We hope that people will adapt the use of NETCONF trough both Node-RED using Red-Netconf and Grafana using the NetconfAggregator.
